# Scientist!

A Ruby library for carefully refactoring critical paths.

## Hacking

Be on a Unixy box. Make sure a modern Bundler is available. `script/test` runs the unit tests. All development dependencies will be installed automatically if they're not available. Science happens primarily on Ruby 2.1.0.
